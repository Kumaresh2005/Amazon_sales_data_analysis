# Amazone_sales_data_analysis
Amazon Sales Data Analysis project using pure SQL. Performed data cleaning, joins(INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL), aggregations, and window functions to analyze sales trends by date, region, and category. Generated insights on revenue, profit, and top-performing products. A strong step forward in my Data Analysis and Data Scientist journey.
